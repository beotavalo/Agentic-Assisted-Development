Ex-Cursor engineer showed me this hack. Changed how I code forever.

"I built a $1.5k MRR app in 3 weeks using Cursor," he said.
"90% AI-written. Want to see how?"

Then he opened his laptop.

What I saw broke my brain:

1️⃣ His Context Hack
He never starts coding immediately.
First: Big picture → Data models → APIs → UI
"Feed Cursor context like you're training a junior dev."

2️⃣ His Test-First Approach
No long requirement docs.
Just comprehensive tests.
Then: "Hey Cursor, make these pass"
Tests become the spec. Genius.

3️⃣ His .cursorrules File
Under 100 lines. Crystal clear.
Patterns, conventions, versions, examples.
"This file is Cursor's operating system. Treat it that way."

4️⃣ His Workspace Setup
Frontend + backend in ONE workspace.
Cursor sees everything. Traces every connection.
"Split workspaces = split brain. Don't do it."

5️⃣ His MCP Strategy
Only 3 servers: Context7, Task Master, GitHub
"More than 3? You're playing yourself."

6️⃣ His Model Mixing
Claude 4 → Planning
Gemini 2.5 Pro → Implementation
o3 → Complex stuff
"Different tools for different jobs. Obviously."

7️⃣ His Golden Rule
"Cursor amplifies everything. 
Good code becomes great. 
Bad code becomes a nightmare. 
Choose wisely."

Then he showed me his GitHub history.
21 days from idea to revenue.
Working 2 hours per evening.

"The secret?" he said. 
"Stop expecting magic. Use it like a power tool. Iterate fast. Ship faster."

Haven't coded the same since.

What Cursor trick changed your workflow?

P.S. That app? Junk Mail Cleaner. Still growing.
The tools are here. The question is: what will you build?
